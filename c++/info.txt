C++ has an abstraction called iostreams to perform

(1) input operations on media (e.g., keyboard, a file, network sockets) 
from which our program can extract characters from sequentially, or
(2) output operations on media (e.g., the terminal, a file, network socket) 
to which our program can print characters to sequentially.

system defined stream object : cout

stream manipulator : endl
1.inserts  "\n" charcter to the end of stream
2.Also flushes the stream so that output is not buffered.
As in some OS buffers the o/p to optimize the I/O efficiency.

3.using namespace increases the posiblity of name-clashing.

c++ predefined types
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types

c++ is statically typed language unlike Python 


 Creating “stub” functions is a good programming habit.

Declaration v/s definition

There can be multiple declaration of an identifier but at most one definition per name.

// definition of function foo()
int foo(int x) {
    return x*x; 
}
 
// definition of struct Date
struct Date {
    int d;
    int m;
    int y;
};


Reference :
A reference is an alias for an existing object. 
We define a reference to an object of 
type T by T& ref = t where t is an existing object/variable of type T

When you use pass-by-value, the compiler copies the value of an argument in a calling function 
to a corresponding non-pointer or non-reference parameter in the called function definition. 
The parameter in the called function is initialized with the value of the passed argument. 
As long as the parameter has not been declared as constant, 
the value of the parameter can be changed, 
but the changes are only performed within the scope of the called function only; 
they have no effect on the value of the argument in the calling function.


Another situation when we might want to pass by reference is 
when the object(s) passed as argument to a function is really large. 
In such a case, pass-by-value wastes both time (for copying the value into the function’s argument) 
and space (for storing the copy).

A copy constructor is for creating a new object from an old object (of the same type). The copy constructor is called in the following three situations:

We declare a variable and initialize it using another object: UBVector vec1(vec2);
An object is passed by value into a function
An object is returned by value from a function
